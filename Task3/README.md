# Task 2 - Display data visually for traders
I used Perspective to generate a live graph that displayed the data feed in a clear and visually appealing way for traders to monitor a trading strategy. The ratio between two stock prices was tracked and displayed along with the upper and lower bounds on the graph. Alerts were also shown whenever these bounds were crossed by the ratio.
